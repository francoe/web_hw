                <h3>About this project</h3>
                <p>The Purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes
                    as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first
                    pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset for over 500 cities.
                </p>
                <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the
                    weather vs. latitude. Factors explored included temperature, cloud cover, wind speed,
                    and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part
                    of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations
                    witnessed
